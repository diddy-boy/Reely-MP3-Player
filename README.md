Meet the Reely-MP3 Player, a piece of digital hardware so committed to retro-futurism that it requires a whopping 950 pixels of screen real estate to look chunky enough to be taken seriously. 
It's encased in a simulated "chunky dark walnut wood grain effect because nothing says "cutting edge MP3 technology" like a giant piece of furniture from 1975. 
This faux-wood cabinet is home to: - Two Enormous Reels: These 350px by 350px behemoths spin to simulate the mechanical progress of your digital audio file, with simulated "tape thickness" as your MP3 track progresses.
Watching a tiny digital file spool onto the right reel like a blockbuster movie master tape is truly a sight to behold. 
VU Meters: Two ridiculously oversized Volume Unit (VU) meters for the "LEFT CHANNEL" and "RIGHT CHANNEL" that don't actually measure volume. 
A beautiful, glowing green-on-black Vacuum Fluorescent Display (VFD) playlist of songs
